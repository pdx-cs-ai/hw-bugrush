# Bug Rush Instances
Bart Massey 2023-10

These are instances of "Bug Rush", a name for the special
case of [Rush
Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_%28puzzle%29)
with vehicles of length one only.

The instances are in an ASCII format described by and
intended for the homework in my AI class. As a brief
example:

is a 3Ã—3 Bug Rush instance. The top row indicates the width
of the puzzle and can be otherwise ignored. In the remaining
rows, `|` indicates a vertically-moving vehicle and `-` a
horizontally-moving one. The target car is represented by
`>` and must be moved to the right edge of the lot: it can
move left or right.
